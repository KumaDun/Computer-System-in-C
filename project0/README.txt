respond to project 0 descripton prompt
From the week1 content, I got familiar with the tool like Docker,
GitHub and VS. This is fantastic because without the tutorial
video it would be much harder to get in. I really looking foward
to finish the system programming course on those platforms and
hopefully this can give more skills in real job market. Thank you
prof. Loo!
